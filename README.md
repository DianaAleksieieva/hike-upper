🌲 HikeUpper
HikeUpper is a mobile app designed to inspire outdoor enthusiasts to not only explore nature, but also to give back by helping clean it. The concept is simple: hike, collect garbage, take pictures, and earn rewards.

By combining environmental responsibility with gamification, HikeUpper encourages users to document trash they collect during hikes, earn points, and redeem them for items in the app store, including free state park parking or entrance passes.

📸 How It Works
Go for a hike or an outdoor walk.

Collect the garbage you find along the way.

Take a photo using the app to log your contribution.

Earn points for each verified upload.

Redeem points in the store for real-world perks.
